# Elaborato_ASDI
This repository contains a collection of VHDL exercises developed as part of the Digital Systems Architecture course.

Each exercise focuses on the modeling, simulation, and (in selected cases) hardware implementation of digital systems. The repository includes:
- Detailed architectural descriptions
- VHDL code developed using both structural and behavioral modeling
- Dedicated testbenches for functional verification
- Simulation results and brief implementation notes

Topics covered include:
- Synchronous counters and shift registers
- Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- Serial communication via UART
- Handshaking protocols
- Carry Look-Ahead Adders
- Multistage interconnection networks (Omega Network)
- Sequence detectors
- Booth multiplier for signed binary multiplication

For selected exercises, the VHDL designs are synthesized and implemented on the Digilent Nexys A7-50T FPGA board, with appropriate pin constraints and timing considerations.

This repository serves as a technical reference for learning and practicing digital system design using VHDL, simulation environments, and FPGA-based prototyping.
